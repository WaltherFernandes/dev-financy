## Differences from the original project

* Project using SASS
* Transaction edit option
* Automatically money format based on the navigator language (I'm starter)
* Custom error message
* Create new array if not exists the local data
* Some different ways to do the JavaScript code

## Rockeseat and FCamara who am I?
🚏 My name is Walther, I'm 16, and I'm from Barão de Cocais, MG, Brazil but at 2019 I moved to Timóteo, MG, Brazil to join the institution CEFET-MG, where I fell in love with programming.    
📚 I'm currently studying systems development technical course, 11th grade. Until then already learned data structure, programming logic initially with Portugol Studio, HTML, CSS Basic, JS Basic, Java, PHP, JQuery and Bootstrap at the course.
👨‍💻 The RocketSeat's Discorver course (Big Mayk ❣) boosted my knowledge in an incredible way in addition to the enchanting experience I had at the last NLW. I believe that the course would help to further level up, having a course set up exclusively for that.
